# Model-Goodness-and-Regularization
 Creating a linear regression model for the cereal dataset. Create another linear regression after removing two variables (sodium and sugars). Compare the AIC, BIC, and Adjusted R-squared variables between the full model and the model with two less variables. Which one is a better model based on those model goodness measures? (split into 20/80% for test/train )
